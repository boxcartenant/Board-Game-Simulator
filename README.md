This is a board game simulator to help me with playtesting a board game that I'm making for my kids.

The actual board and cards I'm using are secrets for now, (I've also scrubbed most of the lore from the code), but you guys are welcome to mess with the simulator. 

You can add a custom map just by changing "map.png". The "Rules of Play.txt" is accessible from within the application via a "rules" button. It explains the basic features of the app.

This app basically requires a 1080 monitor. If you want to work with less than that, then you can change the map size and implement scrollbars yourself.
